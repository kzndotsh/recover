# BIP39 Seed Phrase and Ethereum Address Derivation

This project comprises a script for discovering valid BIP39 seed phrases from a given template and a script to derive Ethereum addresses from those seed phrases to find a specific target address.

## Features

- Check combinations of seed phrases with unknown words
- Validate seed phrases using BIP39 standards
- Derive Ethereum addresses from validated seed phrases
- Search for a specific Ethereum address derived from valid seed phrases up to specified indices

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Multiprocessing Support

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kzndotsh/recovery
   cd recovery
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Finding Valid Seed Phrases**

   Run the script to identify valid seed phrases by replacing placeholder words:

   ```bash
   python generate_seeds.py
   ```

   This will log valid seed phrases into `valid_seed_phrases.txt`.

2. **Ethereum Address Derivation**

   Use the derived seed phrases to check for a specific Ethereum address:

   ```bash
   python derive_address.py
   ```

   Adjust the `target_address` variable in the script to your desired Ethereum address.

## File Structure

- `valid_seed_phrases.txt`: File where valid seed phrases will be logged.
- `generate_seeds.py`: Script to attempt and check all possible seed phrase combinations.
- `derive_address.py`: Script to derive Ethereum addresses and match against the target address.
